# Practicing K-Means: Isotopic Composition Plutonium Batches
## Repo Overview
This is a short practice to test my skills at clustering! The lab walks through the full clustering process.

## Data Overview
> Name: Isotopic Composition Plutonium Batches
>
> Source: Available as ‘pluton.dat’ from the archive of the University of Antwerpen
>
> Description: The pluton data frame has 45 rows and 4 columns, containing percentages of isotopic composition of 45 Plutonium batches.
>
> Observations: This data is fairly odd and you will see that K-Means may not be ideal in a certain respect but the takeaway is that it can do an ok job with whispy, elongated shapes. A more ideal model would be DBSCAN or a hierachical clustering model.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand basic unsupervised clustering problems.
1. Perform a k-means clustering analysis.
1. Evaluate clusters for fit (ie, tune k).
